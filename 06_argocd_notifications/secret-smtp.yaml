# secret-smtp.yaml
# This file defines a Kubernetes Secret for storing SMTP credentials used by ArgoCD Notifications.

kind: Secret    # Declares that this object is a Secret.
metadata:
  name: argocd-notifications-secret  # Name of the Secret resource.
  namespace: argocd                 # Namespace where the Secret will be created.
type: Opaque  # Generic secret type for arbitrary user-defined data.
stringData:   # Allows you to provide secret data as unencoded strings (Kubernetes will encode them).
  email-username: "your-email@example.com"   # SMTP sender email address (replace with your own).
  email-password: "your-smtp-password"       # SMTP password or app password (replace with your own).

# Note:

# - Replace the placeholder values with your actual SMTP credentials.
# - Using stringData is convenient for writing secrets in plain text; Kubernetes will convert them to base64.
